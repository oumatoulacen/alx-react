# State Management in React Applications

## Purpose of a Reducer and Its Role
Reducers are fundamental to state management in applications built with libraries like Redux. They are responsible for updating the application state in response to dispatched actions. A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as arguments, and returns the new state.

## Why a Reducer Should Stay as Pure as Possible
Reducers should remain pure functions to ensure predictability and maintainability of the application. Pure reducers do not cause side effects and always return the same output for a given input. This makes it easier to reason about state changes and facilitates testing and debugging.

## Why Mutations Should Not Happen Within a Reducer
Mutating the state directly within a reducer violates immutability principles and can lead to unexpected behavior. Instead, reducers should create and return a new state object, leaving the original state untouched. This approach ensures predictability and helps prevent bugs.

## Use of Immutable within the Reducer
Immutable data structures enforce immutability and make it easier to track state changes over time. Libraries like Immutable.js provide tools for working with immutable data structures in JavaScript. By using immutable data, reducers can ensure that state changes are explicit and predictable.

## Use of Normalizr within the App
Normalizr is a library used for normalizing nested JSON data. It helps in flattening complex data structures, making them easier to manage and query. Normalizr is commonly used in conjunction with state management libraries like Redux to normalize data before storing it in the state.

## Selectors: What They Are and When to Use Them
Selectors are functions that encapsulate the logic for retrieving specific pieces of data from the application state. They provide an abstraction layer between components and the state, making it easier to access and derive computed state values. Selectors are useful when dealing with complex state structures or when multiple components need access to the same data consistently.
