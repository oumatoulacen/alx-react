# Redux Connectors and Usage Guide

This guide explains the usage of Redux connectors (container components) and related concepts in a React-Redux application.

## Redux Connectors

Redux connectors are higher-order components used to connect Redux state and actions to React components.

### Functions to Pass to a Connector

1. **mapStateToProps**: Used to subscribe to Redux store updates and map the state to props that are passed to the connected component.
2. **mapDispatchToProps**: Maps action creators to props, allowing the connected component to dispatch actions.

### Mapping Action Creators

To map an action creator to a component using a connector, use `mapDispatchToProps`:

```javascript
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { addTodo } from './actions';

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    addTodo: (text) => dispatch(addTodo(text))
  };
};

export default connect(null, mapDispatchToProps)(TodoForm);
```

### What Redux Providers Are and How to Set Up Your App’s Store

Redux Providers are React components that provide the Redux store to the entire application. You typically wrap your root component with a Provider and pass it the Redux store.

```javascript
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './store';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### How You Can Improve a Connector’s Performance Using Reselect

Reselect is a library for creating memoized selector functions to improve the performance of Redux selectors. It memoizes the result of expensive computations so that the same computation is not repeated unnecessarily.

```javascript
import { createSelector } from 'reselect';

const getTodos = (state) => state.todos;

export const getVisibleTodos = createSelector(
  [getTodos, getVisibilityFilter],
  (todos, visibilityFilter) => {
    // Selector logic
  }
);
```

### How to Use Redux’s Dev Tools to Debug the State of Your Application

Redux DevTools Extension is a browser extension that allows you to inspect the Redux store, track state changes, and debug actions in your application.

```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';
import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension';

const store = createStore(rootReducer, composeWithDevTools());
