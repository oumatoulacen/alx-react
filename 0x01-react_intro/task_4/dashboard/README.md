# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Step 1: Install `gh-pages`
First, ensure that `gh-pages` is installed in your project.

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages

```markdown
# Step 2: Update `package.json`
Add the following configuration to your `package.json` file to specify the homepage URL and define a new script to deploy to GitHub Pages.

## Add the `homepage` Property
Specify the GitHub Pages URL where your application will be hosted. This usually follows the pattern `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>`. If you're deploying to a user or organization page, use `https://<username>.github.io`.

```json
{
  "homepage": "https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>"
}
{
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
  }
}

```markdown
# Step 3: Build and Deploy
Now that you've set up the configuration, build and deploy your application to GitHub Pages.

## Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy

```markdown
# Step 4: Verify Deployment
Once deployed, visit your GitHub Pages URL to ensure the application is working correctly.

- Navigate to `https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>`.
- If you're deploying to a user or organization page, the URL is `https://<username>.github.io`.
- Test the functionality of your application to confirm it's working as expected.
# Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, consider these common troubleshooting steps:

- **Check Branches**: Verify that the `gh-pages` branch was created and contains the build files.
- **GitHub Pages Settings**: Ensure the repository settings in GitHub are set to use the `gh-pages` branch for GitHub Pages.
- **CORS Issues**: If your application makes HTTP requests, ensure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is configured properly.
- **Cache**: If the deployed page doesn't reflect recent changes, clear your browser's cache or wait for GitHub Pages to update.
